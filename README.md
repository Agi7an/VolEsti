Hi, I am Agilan S 
I am currently pursuing M.Sc. Theoretical Computer Science at PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore.
Probelm solving and topics like stochastic processes, convex optimizations and linear algebra are my interests, which makes me believe that I will be suitable for this project.

My submission for the tests can be found in the file 'setup.r' [Completed the first two tests and currently working on the third]

One of my previous R projects can e found at https://github.com/Agi7an/bloomfilter-R

Thank You!
